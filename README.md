 For exercises of specifically the part 3 of Full Stack Open
 In the part 3 of Full Stack Open, it was recommended to create a dedicated git repository for part 3's exercises: "It's recommended to do all of the exercises from this part into a new dedicated git repository, and place your source code right at the root of the repository. Otherwise, you will run into problems in exercise 3.10."
